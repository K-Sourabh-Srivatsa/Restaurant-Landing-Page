# Problem

- The project aims to create a visually appealing and user-friendly landing page for a restaurant named "Khaane-ki-Shaan."
- The website needs to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- The site must provide essential information to potential customers, such as the menu, contact details, opening hours, and an easy way to make reservations.

# Technical Implementation

- **Languages Used:**
    - HTML5 for the basic structure and content of the web pages.
    - CSS3 for styling and layout, including responsive design using media queries.
    - JavaScript for client-side form validation.

- **Libraries Used**:
    - Bootstrap 4.3.1 for its responsive grid system, pre-styled components, and JavaScript plugins.
    - jQuery 3.3.1 and Popper.js 1.14.7 as dependencies for Bootstrap's JavaScript components.
    - Google Fonts to import the 'Big Shoulders Text' font for a unique and stylish typography.

## Implementation

- The website is structured into multiple HTML files (`home.html`, `about.html`, `menu.html`, `contact.html`, `pay.html`) to separate different sections of the site.
- A central CSS file (`index.css`) is used to maintain a consistent look and feel across all pages, with specific styles for different sections like the navigation bar, carousel, and contact form.
- The landing page features a dynamic image carousel, a reservation form, and clear calls-to-action to enhance user engagement.

# Outcome

- The result is a fully functional and responsive restaurant landing page that effectively showcases the brand and offerings of "Khaane-ki-Shaan."
- The website provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, allowing visitors to easily find information and interact with the restaurant.
- The project successfully integrates various web technologies to create a professional and polished online presence for the restaurant.
